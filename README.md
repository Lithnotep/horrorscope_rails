# HORRORSCOPES

HorrorScopes is a fun twist on the classic horoscopes. Horrorscopes strictly predicts your demise according to near earth objects both today and on your birthday.
This is done by utilising several of NASA's APIs.

This application uses Google authentication and Google calendar integration so you can plan accordingly for your upcoming doom.
